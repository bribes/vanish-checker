# How to use
The command you use depends on what command the server has.
The server needs to have one of these commands:
- `/minecraft:tell`
- `/minecraft:me`
- `/minecraft:w`
- `/minecraft:msg`

If the server has these the mod will work.

Commands Aliases:
- `/vanishchecker`
- `/vanishcheck`
- `/vcheck`

If you only type in this case `/vcheck` or any other aliases without a argument it'll default to `/minecraft:tell` if the server doesn't have this but has another one you can use a different one by putting the command name as a argument. Ex. `/vcheck msg`

# Servers that this works on
- blockmania.com (this bug has already been reported)
- tons of other servers I can't say
